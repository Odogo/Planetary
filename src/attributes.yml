# This file is for the default attributes for each generated world [if enabled]
# Otherwise, this file will be used across all worlds if you have it enabled

# If "use-default-attributes" is active, this will be used across all worlds and seperate files will not be generated for each world created.
# If the above is disabled, seperate files will be generated with the same format for each world inside "worlds" in the config file. 
# This, however, will be the baseline for each generation.

# If "use-built-in-attributes" this file has no worth, as the plugin will take over all attributes with the it's own.
